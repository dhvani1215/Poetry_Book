        <p>
          All my delightful dreams I can see in your eyes and they look
          blithely, <br />
          My whole life was spent in the shadow of your joyful cherry garden,<br />

          thoughts <br />
          The smiles that win, the tints that glow, but tell of days in goodness
          spent,<br />
          My mind is felling into your aura, my heart whose love is innocent,
          <br />
          The ravishing wind that passes through you gives me the positivity of
          the whole galaxy,
          <br />
          My devotion towards you is like when the soul of the forest bows
          towards the mountain,
          <br />You always give all reasons to fall for youðŸ«€
        </p>
        <p>
          Relation of you and me is like gleefully spring season, sweet like
          honey<br />
          Glaciers of my memories show all the moments that we made together,<br />
          My all words are echoing of your name, I can see the image in you,
          <br />Soul of yours is as pure as a mirror, and I am that shadow which
          is reflected in you,
